This is a web-app replication of the Simon game.





To build this game, follow these steps:

Create your HTML markup and CSS to position your square or shape. These will be the colors that are randomly selected for the game.
Randomly select a square and fade that color in then out.
Allow the user to click on the square that was selected.
Continue randomly selecting colored square/shapes adding the new random selection to be added to the previous selection. Eventually you will end up with a random sequence of selected colors.
Each time a new color is added to the sequence allow the user to enter (click) the sequence in the order as it was played.
If the user continues to get the order correct then proceed to adding another color to the collection until the user gets the order incorrectly.
Keep track of how many rounds the user is able to go.
